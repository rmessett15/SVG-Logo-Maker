## Technologies Used

This project is powered by Node.js v16, utilizes inquirer v8.2.4 (node package manager), and file system module (node package manager). It also employs jest v29.5.0 (node package manager) for the unit testing conducted in this application.

## Installation

1. Clone the repo:
   git clone https://github.com/rmessett15/SVG-Logo-Maker.git

2. Open in VS Code. If you do not have VS code you must install it.

3. Using the terminal, install node.js v16. If you have homebrew, the command should look like the following (brew install node@16), however this may vary and the documentation should be consulted.

4. Once node.js v16 is installed, in the terminal, utilize the command npm init -y to initialize and create a package.json where project files will be stored.

5. Next, use the terminal to run the command npm i to install the dependencies associated with this application (developers may need to install inquirer and jest directly from the command line, to do so the command for inquirer will be npm i inquirer@8.2.4 to install v8.2.4 of the inquirer, and npm i jest to install the latest version of jest).

6. To run the application, within the terminal, type the command node index.js.

## Credits

Worked with tutor Martin Goldberg to help get me started on this assignment. We pseudo-coded the general outline together and he helped me put together the unit testing portion of this assignment.

Open to collaboration, if you choose to do so open an issue and modify any changes you would like to see on a feature branch and wait for approval before merging to the main branch.

## Test Instructions

To run unit testing, open the terminal, and use the command npm run test.

As of now there is one test suite with three tests. The test suite is checking for a render() method to return a string for the corresponding SVG file with the given shape color.
